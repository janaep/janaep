Hi, Iâ€™m Janae Perez, a junior studying Computer Science at Boston University. I am passionate about making a positive impact in my community and ensuring that I give back to those around me. As an AI/ML Fellow at Break Through Tech AI, I am deepening my knowledge of AI development and working on meaningful projects.

Currently, I serve as the Membership Chair for Girls Who Code at BU, where I focus on organizing events tailored to freshmen and underclassmen, ensuring they have the resources they need to succeed. Additionally, I am a Hackathon Ambassador at BU Spark!, helping to organize hackathons and foster innovation within the tech community.

This upcoming summer, I will be interning at Accenture as a Technology Analyst Intern on the Tech ARC track, where Iâ€™ll assist in delivering top solutions for clients while expanding my technical and consulting skills.

I'm always looking to connect, please email me at jperez26@bu.edu
